# UFOs
##Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with an auto update table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The original webpage that was created only provided users with a date filter. However, for this project, we want to allow users to filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table will include city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The original interation of the webpage included only a date filter. The updated version, users will be able to filter data by selecting the city, state, country and/or shape. The webpage will then automatically filter the table. The first image ilustrates the table without filters. Users can see the type of format that is required for the filter to function in the text box. Upon input, the table will automatically filter the results accordingly.

## Summary of Analysis
One drawback is this is a desktop view only. If tried to view on another device it may not work properly. We also dont have a full URL yet so the file is currently only local.
In the future we could create a URL address for everyone to visit and to make it viewable and editable on mobile or tablet devices.
